    "[ReadTheDocs has a mechanism](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/versions.html) to warn the user if he's looking at an old version of the site, but we found it doesn't work much for course-based documentation. So for versioning we think it's better to adopt a mixed git branch / tags devlopment model, and we added a template warning to show in old branches. To enable it in an old branch, just rename [_templates/breadcrumbs.html.bak](_templates/breadcrumbs.html.bak) into `_templates/breadcrumbs.html` and edit as needed."
